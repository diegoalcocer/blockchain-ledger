# Blockchain Ledger
Blockchain-based ledger system that allows users to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger

---

## Summary

The Pychain ledger contains the following:

* A data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.
* User input areas in the `Streamlit` application. These input areas collect the relevant information for each financial record that youâ€™ll store in the PyChain ledger.
* `Streamlit` is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create web apps

With the pychain ledger you can create multiple blocks and add them to the chain and visualize them.

You can verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu. Also you can visualize a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks.
